About Washut

Washut is basically a laundry based startup. Its main aim to make laundry system smoother and less messy.  Currently, its operates in IIT(ISM) Dhanbad. In coming months it will expand to different states of India. They hired me as an Android developer in my first-year summer. I had to make an android application for them. 

About The Android Application

The Android application which I made is basically for the workers (The washermen)  of Washut. For every worker, there is an account via they login in the application by their username and password.  Via this application they able to view the orders in real time. Among the orders according to their convenience, they can take the orders. Full details of orders are shown in the application like user address, mobile number etc.  Even, they can complain about any customer to the admin via the application if any customer doesn't giving money from many days or any other issue.

One other thing which I made is admin panel. Via admin panel, Admin can see any worker account. In their account, all details will be shown like their personal information, the orders they took on a particular day, their complaints etc.

Tech Stack

1. PHP – As backend language.
2. Android Studio – Used for the making of the Android application.
3. MySql – Used For Database.
4. Bootstrap – For the making of UI of the admin panel.

Future Plans

Now, we are planning to add messaging service like if any worker took the order then the details of worker will be sent to the user in message form.  We are also planning to add wallet service by which user can pay by their wallet like we see in Paytm, Freecharge etc.

If anyone wants to contribute in this project. Feel free to contribute.
